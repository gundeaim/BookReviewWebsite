          <div class="author"><strong>By:</strong> John Flanagan</div>
          <div class="info-review">
            Personally I loved this book. It was so good. I couldn't put it down.
            It follows the story of Will who was grown up as a ward of the state.
            At the beginning of the book he is old enough to chose an apprentinship and
            wants to join battle school, but in a twist of fates he ends up as an apprentices to a
            ranger. The book follows his adventure's as the rangers apprentice. I love the characters
            in this book and I love their development. I love seeing how Will and his friends change and
            grow.

          <div class="info-review">
            This book was pretty good. I think it was a little outside of the genre I normally read, which is probably
            why I don't love it. The writing was good and the story line was interesting, it was just a little sad.
            But, I do think I should have been prepared for that since it is a story about Anastasia right after she loses
            everyone she loves.

          <div class="title"><strong>Title:</strong> Of Beast and Beauty</div>
          <div class="author"><strong>By:</strong> Chanda Hahn</div>
          <div class="info-review">
            My thoughts on this book vary. I can't quite make up my mind about it. So lets start with the good parts.
            There were a lot of parts of this book that I really enjoyed. I liked the story line of how Rosalie grew up
            and it made a lot of sense in the end when she finds her parents and understands all that her adoptive mom did for her.
            The thing that was so hard for me throughout this book is I felt like she would show time after time that she was a good
            person and yet no one would give her a shot and then she would just forgive them. That kind of drove me crazy.
